-Title Bucket List Travels

The aim of the website is to allow users to view different countries and find out which cities they contain, and also allow the user to add them to their bucket list, and check off which destinations have been visited, and which ones are still to be visited.

The user can create a country and add it to the list of countries on the destinations page. Each country can be edited, and the cities within the countries can be added or removed.

On the bucket list page, they can choose from the list of countries that are available on the destinations page and add them to a visited list or not visited list.


PLANNING -

I started off by drawing class diagrams to ensure I had an understanding of the relationships between the classes.

I then moved on to drawing a wireframe for each page to get a rough idea of how I wanted my website to look, as you can see, as I have worked on my website I have made some changes to the original plan.
